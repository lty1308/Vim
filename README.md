# My Vimrc

Inspired by [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/), I decided to make my own vimrc for the purpose of learning and also synchronizing my vim configuration thru all my devices.

There are two vimrc files included:

* **basic.vim**: Include a basic vim setup   
* **plugin.vim**: Deal with plugin configuration used

## How to install

    git clone git://github.com/lty1308/Vim.git ~/.vim_tyli
    sh ~/.vim_tyli/install.sh

## How to update

    cd ~/.vim_tyli
    git pull --rebase

## Functions

* **Absolute/Relative line number toggle** - This function acts as the switch between absolute and relative line number by pressing <C-n>

## Plugins

* [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen): Manages the runtime path of the plugins
* [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): A tree explorer plugin for vim
* [Supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab): Use Tab for all insert completion needs

Thank you! Enjoy~
