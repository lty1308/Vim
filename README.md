# My Vimrc

Inspired by [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/), I decided to make my own vimrc for the purpose of learning and also synchronizing my vim configuration thru all my devices.

There are two vimrc files included:

* **basic.vim**: Include a basic vim setup   
* **plugin.vim**: Deal with plugin configuration used

## How to install

    git clone git://github.com/lty1308/vim.git ~/.vim_tyli
    sh ~/.vim_tyli/install.sh

## Plugins

* [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen): Manages the runtime path of the plugins
* [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): A tree explorer plugin for vim

Thank you! Enjoy~
